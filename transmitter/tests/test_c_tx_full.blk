-- Test created using Annex G, IEEE Standard_802.11a-1999


-- See createPreamble.blk for explanation
#define SHORT_FFT


#include <bits.blk>

fun comp convert_to_bits() {
var ai : arr[1] int8;
var ab : arr[8] bit;

  repeat {
    x<-take;
    do{
      ai[0] := x;

  }
}


-- Note, we don't implement the filter from 802.11a-1999 but we modify 
-- the data to match the one without the filter (only each 80th sample changes)
-- Also note that 802.11a-1999, Annex G has an error in the scrambling output
-- Hence we recreate the test using our own code, which seems correct
